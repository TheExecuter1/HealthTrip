# HealthTrip
The file structure is as followed :

each folder with hospital name contains the scraping script, scraped data , cleaning script and cleaned data.

I have used 2 different frameworks approches for scrapping 
1. Selenium
2. Beautiful soup

The folder with name "Cleaned data" containes the data file "all_cleaned_merged" that has to be injested into the model.

injest this file and run the privategpt script to interact with the model.
